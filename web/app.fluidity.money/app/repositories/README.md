# Repositories

I couldn't think of a better name for these.

### What's a repository

These process queries into a more useful format, like a serializer;

Transform data to a simpler more useful format;

Then store things in memory as a useState.

Why not work with these directly in the query?

We _did_ and it was:

- Hard to test
- Easy to duplicate code
- Easy to introduce bugs
- Cluttered up page code
- Hard to maintain

That's why we have this ðŸ˜„
